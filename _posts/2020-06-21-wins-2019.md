The “Students WIN with UTEP Tech-E” program is a UTEP and Socorro Independent School District initiative to create opportunities for and access to Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM) skills development in support of longer-term social mobility for K-12 students.

The program will expose students to a wide range of technologies to better prepare them to make career and future degree choices based on real-world hands-on experiences at a younger age; engaging them in academic programs, technical jobs, and STEAM fields before they begin their true career planning choices.

WIN is a student-centered program created to help ensure all Team SISD children have the opportunities and support needed to achieve academic success. WIN is an acrostic that outlines the keys to winning in life.
