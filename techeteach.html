				<h2>Building <strong>future</strong> educators</h2>
				<p>A new grant funded program that is focused on growing our future technology enabled teachers. This program kicks off this Spring 2020 and will teach K-12 teachers/administrators about a wide range of current and future technologies/pedagogies so they can begin planning and implementing them in their day to day curriculums in the local community.
